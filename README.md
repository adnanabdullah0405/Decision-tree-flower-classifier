# Decision-tree-flower-classifier
Supervised learning project using a Decision Tree Classifier to accurately classify different species of flowers based on their morphological features. Demonstrates model training, visualization, and evaluation with over 90% accuracy.
# Flower Classification using Decision Tree Classifier 

##  Overview

This project applies a **Decision Tree Classifier** to classify flower species based on key morphological features such as petal and sepal length/width. It's a classic example of supervised learning, providing interpretable and accurate predictions for multi-class classification problems.

---

##  Objective

To train a Decision Tree model that accurately classifies the type of flower using features from a labeled dataset, demonstrating how tree-based algorithms can handle feature-based decision making.

---

##  Problem Type

- **Type**: Supervised Learning
- **Task**: Multi-class Classification
- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree Classifier

---

##  Dataset

The model is trained on a flower classification dataset (e.g., Iris dataset), which includes:

- **Features**:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width

- **Target**:
  - Species (e.g., Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

##  Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data handling
  - `scikit-learn` – Modeling and evaluation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
  - `graphviz` or `sklearn.tree.plot_tree` – Decision tree visualization

---
## Evaluation
Training Accuracy: 97.3%

Testing Accuracy: 94.6%

The model shows high performance on both training and testing datasets, indicating it generalizes well without overfitting.
